v9.9.1

Schema validation results now enumerated to a list upon validation (prevents multiple evaluations).

Fixed an issue with downloading schemata stored in local files.

v9.9.0

Added `SchemaErrorMessages` static class which contains tokenized error messages.  All built-in validators use these error messages.
